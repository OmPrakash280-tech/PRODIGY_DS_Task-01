"Analyze and visualize Indian state/UT population dynamics using Python &amp; Matplotlib."


Population Analysis of States/UTs in India
This project aims to provide insights into the population distribution of states and union territories (UTs) in India. It includes analysis and visualization of urban and rural populations, as well as the distribution of boys and girls across different regions.

Introduction:
The population analysis of states and UTs in India is crucial for understanding demographic trends, urbanization patterns, and gender distribution across the country. This project utilizes Python and Matplotlib to visualize population data, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights into demographic dynamics.

Features:
Urban vs. Rural Population: Visualize the distribution of urban and rural populations across states/UTs.
Gender Distribution: Analyze the distribution of boys and girls in different regions of India.
Interactive Visualization: Create interactive bar charts and histograms for enhanced data exploration.

Dataset:
The project uses population data sourced from reputable sources, such as government databases or international organizations. The dataset contains demographic information for each state and UT, including urban and rural populations, as well as gender-wise population statistics.

Usage:
Data Preparation: Ensure that the population dataset is available and properly formatted.
Install Dependencies: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run Analysis: Execute the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook to perform population analysis and visualization.
Explore Visualizations: Interact with the generated visualizations to gain insights into population dynamics.
